## About The Project

The Pandemic will (eventually) come to an end, and the birthday bashes, backyard BBQs, and breathtaking banquets will resume. When this time comes, party planners will need an easy way to keep track of upcoming parties and the details that come along with them. Party Perfect was created to do just that. With this application, the user can add upcoming parties to their home page, and keep track of the party schedule, invited attendees, needed supplies, and can even view past events.

## Usage

To use this application, the user must login, or if not already a member, create an account. Once logged in, the user will be directed to their own personal member's page, where previously created parties will appear. Users will also be able to search through their calendar to view upcoming or past parties.
